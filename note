g2w - Go to Work folder

v3.0.0

Date: 2016.05.18

Note: This version is rewritten but I think it's good!

The tip is use source to run script on parent and use alias to run "source g2w" command. The most important thing is there must be no exit command in g2w script, otherwise the shell will terminate itself.

--------------------
V1.2

Date: 2014.11.12
Update:
	- add /etc/g2w.conf file
	- add list/silance mode, default silant mode...or manual individually
	ok - sw -> sort output alphabetically


Installation
    add line to ~/.bashrc
	alias gw="source g2w"
