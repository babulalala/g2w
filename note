g2w - Go to Work folder
--------------------
2017.08.02
- refactor clean_list
- refactor sw -u

- After half year I restart to handle this project. The work now is:
-> This project must be test driven (TDD) i.e. need test cases and some kind of shell test framework. I will use shUnit2 for unitest. For E2E I have not found the solution yet, maybe I'll develope one when I'm familiar with Kama.
-> may need to refact update_tag function, perform no check and note in description that user have check before calling this function.
-> Refact that the tiers of functions must not be over some level (2 or 3)???? In the other words, a function can't call too many functions. (for shell performance)

- Finished conflict part, need to rest for long time. The next feature is rollback from failed operation gw aaa to sw aaa.
- And next time I need to arrange/clean git commits and add tag for version.

2017.01.05
- I forget why sw should be set as alias???
Ans. Because sw will set shell variable, it must run as login shell.

- There are still lots of features needed to develop. In order to make the progress more easier, the following things must be solved at first.
1. function management: a program to scan the script and export the function details.
comment format:
#
# function:
#	func1	description
# input:
#	arg1	description
#	arg2	description
#	arg3	description
# output:
# 	output	description
#
func1() {
	xxxxx
}

=> export
 function:
	func1	description
 input:
	arg1	description
	arg2	description
	arg3	description
 output:
 	output	description

2. function rule
_<function name> := disposable function i.e. if you see this function, don't think to use it
<function name> := reusable function i.e. if you see this function, you can reuse it.

3. about version
I have to think about it again. Is it really important to note every script a version or just use one package version?

- Actually it must be very careful when using g2w shell variables. Sugestion is to varify content of var before using it. But wondering I found in Cygwin (don't know in CentOS) shell has auto completion function for variables. It prevents some mistakes like typo, very good. But g2w auto completion feature still needed especially when I found it is so effective on shell.

--------------------
v3.0.0

Date: 2016.05.18

Note: This version is rewritten but I think it's good!

The tip is use source to run script on parent and use alias to run "source g2w" command. The most important thing is there must be no exit command in g2w script, otherwise the shell will terminate itself.

--------------------
V1.2

Date: 2014.11.12
Update:
	- add /etc/g2w.conf file
	- add list/silance mode, default silant mode...or manual individually
	ok - sw -> sort output alphabetically


Installation
    add line to ~/.bashrc
	alias gw="source g2w"

--------------------
Log
2014.11.12

2014.11.04 - not finish but works, lack some functions but do it later.

2014.11.03 - stop here, I am tired!
