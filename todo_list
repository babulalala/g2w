4. Info for first installation, recent terminal needs to source ~/.bashrc or log out then log in....(effect by next login) (refine,minor)
e.g.
you may manually add xxx in ~/.bashrc
then exit terminal and re-enter again
...

5. Refine README (refine,minor)

7. delete multi-tags (feature,minor)

8. how to handle when 1. new shell opening. 2. set shell var name the same existing tag. 3. run sw. => conflicted tag has now shell var and prompt warning. (bug,major)
(should I check var content? If they are different then conflic....)
e.g.
		a. open terminal -> no sw shell vars now
		b. set a=123 as shell var and a is tag existing in sw
		c. run sw, shell vars will be created according to tags
		d. when create a, a is alread existing in shell -> error!!

another case
		a. user bob use sw then su to root
		b. now root wants to sw tag work, but it was used by bob -> work is alread existing in shell -> error!! Because they use the same shell environment.

solution:
		1. when sw create shell vars, when confliction appears, create only tag and warm the user.
		e.g.
		# sw
		(Warning! One conflic found.)
		run	/var/run
		*work	/opt/work

		=> *means shell var conflict and their value may be different

		2. when sw tag and get conflict, user can run sw tag -t (-t for tag only) to add path to tag.
		e.g.
		# sw work
		error
		# sw work -t /# sw -t work
		(Warning! One conflic found.)
		run	/var/run
		*work	/opt/work

So, it meaning the user have to use this tag carefully.

10. refine script install (need add more functions) (refine,minor)

11. sw can use another .sw file. (feature,minor)
$ sw -f <.sw file>

12. sw can import/mirage another .sw fiel. (feature,minor)
case 1 for import
$ sw -im <.sw file>
sw will import tags from <.sw file>, your recent tag data will be deleted.
Are you sure? [n/y]: y
.....

case 2 for mirage
$ sw -mg <.sw file>
sw will mirage <.sw file> to your xx.sw.
Are you sure? [n/y]: y
add tag1 /xxx/xxx .... ok
add tag2 /xxx/xxx .... failed - tag already exists
add tag3 /xxx/xxx .... failed - env var already exists <= can use flag -to (tag only) to add it
add tag4 /xxx/xxx .... ok

tag1 /xxxxx
tag2 /xxxxx
tag4 /xxxx
otg1 /xxxx
otg2 /xxx

13. Can sort sw output by tag name or by path. (feature,minor)

14. Huston we got a problem! recently alias set in /etc/profile, but it will not affect in sub-shell, need to solve this problem. (bug,critical)
=> need to change profile to /etc/bash.bashrc - v4.0.5/2016.07.27
=> It is shxt that bash.bashrc is available for Cygwin but not CentOS
=> I think the right way is to write the script in /etc/profile.d/.
So I have to modify script install
#(don't need)	1. check shell (which os?)
#(don't need)		$ uname -o
#(don't need)		Cygwin: Cygwin
#(don't need)		CentOS/Linux: GNU/Linux
#(don't need)	2. check file existance
#(don't need)	if [ -r $file ]
	3. copy g2w.sh to /etc/profile.d/
	4. please re-login....
2016.07.28
It is shit again that the g2w.sh doesn't work for Cygwin and CentOS/sh. I am confused... Really need to test these login script...sigh....
By the way, should I strict the usage only in bash? should be, because I only use it on bash.

15. Add tested on bash. (refine,minor)

--------------------------------------------------
Finished:
1. can't update tag with new path -> break in check environment variable (bug,major) - v4.0.3/2016.07.06
6. tag name include dash e.g. 'a-a' results error "tag name already exists in shell" (bug,major) - v4.0.3/2016.07.06
9. like vi :version, the user can see info where is his .sw file located. (refine,none) - v4.0.4/2016.07.07
3. move .sw file to ~/.sw?? (refine,minor) - v4.0.4/2016.07.07
